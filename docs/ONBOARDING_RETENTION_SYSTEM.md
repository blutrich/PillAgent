  - 🚀 Get stronger overall
  - 🏆 Prepare for competition
- Capture custom goals if needed
- Use `goalSettingTool` to process and validate response

**Expected Outcome**: User feels understood and excited about their chosen goal

### Step 2: Current Level Check (60 seconds)
**Purpose**: Establish accurate baseline for program generation

**Process**:
- Ask about hardest boulder grade successfully sent
- Provide visual examples and grade explanations
- Assess confidence level at current grade (1-5 scale)
- Determine climbing experience (years)
- Use `currentLevelCheckTool` to analyze progression pattern

**Expected Outcome**: Realistic assessment with encouraging feedback about growth potential

### Step 3: Mini Physical Assessment (2 minutes)
**Purpose**: Generate precise composite score for program personalization

**Process**:
- Explain importance of physical metrics for customization
- Guide through 3 core tests:
  1. **Max Pull-ups**: Bodyweight strength indicator
  2. **Fingerboard Test**: Finger strength with added weight (20mm edge)
  3. **Core Test**: Max toe-to-bar or knee raises
- Collect body weight and height for normalization
- Use `miniPhysicalAssessmentTool` to calculate composite score

**Expected Outcome**: User understands their strengths/weaknesses and predicted grade capability

### Step 4: Schedule Setup (45 seconds)
**Purpose**: Ensure program fits user's lifestyle for consistency

**Process**:
- Present popular training schedules (Mon/Wed/Fri, Tue/Thu/Sat, Custom)
- Ask about preferred session length (60/90/120 minutes)
- Determine preferred training time (morning/afternoon/evening)
- Use `scheduleSetupTool` to validate feasibility

**Expected Outcome**: Realistic training schedule that maximizes adherence probability

### Step 5: Equipment Check (30 seconds)
**Purpose**: Adapt program to available resources

**Process**:
- Survey available equipment:
  - 🏢 Climbing gym access
  - 🏠 Home fingerboard
  - 🏔️ Outdoor climbing areas
  - 💪 Basic fitness equipment
  - 📱 Phone-only setup
- Use `equipmentCheckTool` to customize program accordingly

**Expected Outcome**: User confident that program works with their setup

### Step 6: Program Generation (15 seconds)
**Purpose**: Deliver immediate value and create excitement

**Process**:
- Synthesize all collected data
- Generate full climbing assessment using existing `climbingAssessmentTool`
- Create personalized 6-week program using `programGenerationTool`
- Present results with enthusiasm and clear next steps

**Expected Outcome**: User has complete, personalized training program and clear path forward
